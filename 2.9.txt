exercise 2.9 

explain the following definitions. for those that are illegal, explain what wrong
and how to correct it.

A: std::cin >> int input_value;       cant put a value on a line

    error: expected '(' for function-style cast or type construction.

    int input_value = 0;
    std::cin >> input_value;


B: int i = { 3.14 };                  should be double

    error: type 'double' cannot be narrowed to 'int' in initializer list.

    double i = { 3.14 };

C: double salary = wage = 9999.99;    cant double declare like that

     if declared 'wage' before, it's right. Otherwise, error would be happened: error: use of undeclared identifier 'wage'

    double wage;
    double salary = wage = 9999.99;

D: int i = 3.14;                      should be double

    Ok: but value will be truncated.

    double i = 3.14;
