Exercise 2.10
What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables ?

    std::string global_str;
    int global_int:                 // empty
    int main()                      // 0
    {
        int local_int;              // 0
        std::string local_str;      // error
    }


>global_str is global variable, so the value is empty string.
>global_int is global variable, so the value is zero.
>local_int is a local variable which is not uninitialized, so it has a undefined value.
>local_str is also a local variable which is not uninitialized, but it has a value that is defined by the class. So it is empty string.

PS: please read P44 in the English version, P40 in Chinese version to get more information.

Uninitialized objects of built-in type defined inside a function body have a undefined value. Objects of class type that 
we do not explicitly initialize have a value that is defined by class.
